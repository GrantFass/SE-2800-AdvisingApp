     * The generic validateFileLocation(location) method tests if a file exists or not so it needs to be compared
     *   against files that exist and those that do not.
     * The overloaded validateFileLocation(location, expectedFileExtension) method tests if a file exists by calling
     *   the generic method and also validates that the location ends with the proper extension. Since this uses
     *   the generic method it should only need to test the location extension.

     *   validation method). This method will primarily test that the proper exceptions are thrown, as well as a
     *   basic test for proper returned values.
