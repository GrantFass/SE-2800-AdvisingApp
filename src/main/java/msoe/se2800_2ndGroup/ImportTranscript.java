 * * File Created by toohillt on Saturday, 20 March 2021
 * * Modify the readInFile method to return the list of courses directly instead of using a private var and a getter by Grant Fass on Tue, 13 Apr 2021
 * * Add methods to remove ignored words and extract course codes from each input line by Grant Fass on Thu, 15 Apr 2021
 * * Clean up main readInFile method by removing extra data structures, adding comments, and adding methods by Grant Fass on Thu, 15 Apr 2021
 * * Update parsing to skip courses that were withdrawn from or failed by Grant Fass on Thu, 15 Apr 2021
 * * Fix error preventing courses with the word 'organization' in the description from being read by Grant Fass on Thu, 15 Apr 2021
